# Product Requirements Document: AllInBee - Frontend Web Application

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Project:** AllInBee Frontend Mobile Application Webpage

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the product requirements for the AllInBee Frontend Web Application. This application will serve as the primary user interface for Ã‡ankaya University students and staff to access AllInBee services. It will be a web application designed with a mobile-first approach, providing a user experience akin to a native mobile app but accessible via a web browser.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope includes the design and development of all user-facing features, including User Management, Cafeteria System, Ring Bus Tracking, and Appointment System. The frontend will consume the AllInBee Backend API for all data display and manipulation.

### 1.3 Goals
*   To provide an intuitive, responsive, and accessible user interface for all AllInBee services.
*   To deliver a seamless user experience that feels like a mobile application.
*   To accurately display data retrieved from the backend API.
*   To enable users to perform all intended actions (e.g., payments, bookings, tracking) efficiently.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The AllInBee Frontend is a client-side web application, likely built with Next.js/React. It will make asynchronous requests to the AllInBee Backend API to fetch and submit data. It will manage client-side state, user sessions (via NextAuth), and render the UI dynamically. The design will prioritize a mobile viewport but should be responsive enough to be usable on larger screens if accessed.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   The AllInBee Backend API is available and provides the necessary endpoints as specified in its PRD.
*   UI/UX designs (wireframes, mockups, style guides) for the application are available or will be developed.
*   The application will be accessible via modern web browsers on various devices.

## 3. Specific Frontend Features

### 3.1 Core UI/UX Features
*   **FR-FE-CORE-1 (Mobile-First Layout):** The primary layout should be optimized for mobile screen sizes.
